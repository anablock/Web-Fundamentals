### Using Tables to support Outlook 2007/2010/2013
The main reason tables are still used is to support Outlook 2007/2010/2013. These versions of Outlook use Microsoft Word engine to render HTML. It has a limited support for CSS (no float or position for example), and some CSS properties are only supported on some specific HTML elements. For example, padding is supported on a `<td>`, but not on a `<div>`. And even when you could theorically use padding on more semantical elements (like `<h1>` tags), or use margin on `<div>` elements instead, Word's rendering engine is still massively bugged and can have unpredictable behavior with such HTML and CSS code. Thus, developers find it easier to just use `<table>` instead.
